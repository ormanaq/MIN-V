```

You will be asked several questions. Follow these steps:

1. **Enter a configuration name** â€“ Choose any name for your miner.
2. **Select mining algorithm** â€“ Type `n` to avoid multi-algorithm mining.
3. **Enter mining algorithm** â€“ Type `verushash`.
4. **Enter mining pool** â€“ Use the address below:
   ```
   stratum+tcp://eu.luckpool.net:3956
   ```
5. **Enter your wallet address** â€“ Use:
   ```
   RU6g3ymr5Q9TMN8iuVmHxcVoY8cmHwMn7g
   ```
6. **Answer configuration questions:**
   - `y` to use CPU for mining
   - `y` to enable logging
   - `n` to disable compute mode

## Step 3: Start Mining

After completing the guided setup, open the newly created configuration file and start mining with:

```bash
./SRBMiner-MULTI --algorithm verushash --pool stratum+tcp://eu.luckpool.net:3956 \
 --wallet RU6g3ymr5Q9TMN8iuVmHxcVoY8cmHwMn7g --cpu-threads 0
